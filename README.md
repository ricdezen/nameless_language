# Nameless Language

I am currently reading a very nice book called [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). In this
repository is the code for my version of Lox, which is just the one in the book but commented by me as I go.

I will take inspiration from the book's exercises to further develop the language, until it becomes worthy of a name.

Reached chapter 14.3.1
